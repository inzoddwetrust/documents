Suppliers provide liquidity to the market to earn a passive income, while borrowers are able to borrow in an overcollateralized (perpetually) or undercollateralized (one-block liquidity) fashion. The protocol has been audited and secured. The Aave Protocol is maintained and upgraded by the decentralized Aave governance system. AAVE token holders collectively act as governors of the protocol."
