RUG PULL: +40,000% pump followed by -99.99% crash. Team sold everything, removed liquidity, deleted social media.\n\n5. NO PRODUCT: Despite claims of play-to-earn gaming platform, zero evidence of any actual game development.\n\n6. HONEYPOT CONTRACT: Smart contract designed to trap funds. Users could deposit but not withdraw.\n\n7. DISAPPEARED: Website, Twitter, Telegram all deleted immediately after rug pull.\n\n8. MILLIONS LOST: Investors lost millions of dollars in hours.\n\nTYPICAL RUG PULL PATTERN:\n- Hype around trending topic (Squid Game)\n- Anonymous team\n- Fake partnerships\n- Anti-sell mechanism\n- Pump via fake news\n- Dump everything\n- Delete all traces\n- Disappear with money\n\nThis is a TEXTBOOK SCAM. Avoid at all costs. Anyone promoting similar projects should be treated with extreme suspicion."
